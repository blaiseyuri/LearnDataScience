    "### Research\n",
    "What I've realized I am interested in is not just the pure crime rate but determining what makes a city have a bad crime rate. So my first order of business is to determine what a bad crime rate is. In the United States there is no formal classification of cities based on their crime rate, this means I will have to create my own definition. The ghetto is one of the worst places to live in the United States due to the fact these areas have high crime rates. Most U.S citizens would agree that a cities crime rate is too high if it is similiar to that of a ghetto. So if I find the average crime rate of ghettos than I can use that information as the basis for my classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining Ghetto\n",
    "Turns out the United States does not have any official measurements to determine what constitutes a ghetto, in fact the U.S doesn't even give an official definition of what a ghetto is. Luckily there is a classification officially defined by the U.S Census Bureau called **Concentrated Poverty** that does a good job encapsulating what the ghetto is. The definition given by the bureau is an area with 40 percent of the tract population living below the federal poverty threshold [1]. While it is argued that the 40 percent cutoff is arbitrary, scholars recognize that the cutoff did correspond closely with neighborhoods that city officials and Local Census Bureau Officials considered ghettos [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will now classify each community based on how its crime rate relates to the crime rate of the average area that has concentrated poverty (effectively making it a ghetto).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the data\n",
    "Getting U.S census data was not fun, and was probably a lot more work than it was worth. The data on poverty in the U.S is very granular and goes down all the way to U.S census tracts but the best data I could find for crime in the same time frame is down to the city level for cities with populations above 25,000. In hindsight I probably could've used the crime data from UCI that we are analyzing now but oh well. So I got the poverty levels for the large cities but to make up for the change in size (from U.S census tract to U.S city) I've changed the sample size by selecting areas with poverty levels above 20%. Areas with poverty levels above 20% are still above the national average and are just as concerning since cities are much larger than tracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "After messing around in Excel I was able to clean up the data and get the poverty rate and crime rate (both violent and nonviolent) of 1172 cities across all 50 states. So lets take a look at the csv I made.\n",
